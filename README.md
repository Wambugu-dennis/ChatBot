# ChatBot

The following is a readme for a Python chatbot that can be modified for any use case. The chatbot uses the Google Custom Search API to search the internet for answers to user-inputted questions.

# Getting Started

To use the chatbot, you will need to install the requests library, which can be done by running the following command:

           pip install requests
           
You will also need to obtain an API key and search engine ID from the Google Custom Search API and replace the APIKEY and ENGINEID placeholders in the code with your own values.

# Usage 

To start the chatbot, run the chatbot() function. The chatbot will prompt the user for their name and then ask them to choose one of three services: cybersecurity, web development, or data analytics. The user can enter the number of the service they are interested in to receive answers to their questions about that service.

If the user enters "change" at any point, they will be prompted to choose a different service. If the user enters "quit", the chatbot will terminate.

The chatbot will only provide answers to questions that include details of a question, such as "what", "why", "how", "define", "where", or "when". If the user's input does not include these details, the chatbot will ask the user to provide a valid question.

# Customization

The chatbot can be customized in a number of ways to suit different use cases. The list of services and the responses to user-inputted questions can be changed by modifying the appropriate lines of code. The chatbot can also be trained on different data to provide more accurate answers to user questions.
To further customize the chatbot, you can modify the search() function to use a different search engine or change the way the search results are processed and returned to the user. Additionally, you can add more features to the chatbot, such as the ability to browse the internet or support for additional languages.

# Conclusion

This Python chatbot provides a basic framework for creating a chatbot that can be tailored to different use cases. By modifying the code and incorporating additional features, you can create a chatbot that is well-suited to your specific needs.
